## Overview
Shaheer-Microservices-CloudLab is a comprehensive cloud-native microservices repository designed for scalable, high-performance applications. This project integrates modern DevOps tools and methodologies to deploy and manage microservices efficiently using Kubernetes, Istio, and Terraform across AWS and Azure environments.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Containerized microservices deployed using Docker & Kubernetes.
- **Service Mesh with Istio**: Secure and manage microservices traffic efficiently.
- **Ingress & API Gateway**: Centralized traffic routing using Kubernetes Ingress.
- **Cloud Agnostic**: Supports AWS and Azure cloud providers.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Uses Terraform for automated cloud resource provisioning.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus for metrics and centralized logging.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated deployment with GitHub Actions & ArgoCD.

## Architecture
### High-Level Workflow
1. Code is pushed to GitHub.
2. CI/CD pipelines trigger builds and tests.
3. Docker images are pushed to container registries.
4. Kubernetes deploys microservices across cloud environments.
5. Istio handles service-to-service communication.
6. Prometheus monitors application health and performance.

## Technologies Used
| Category | Tools |
|----------|---------|
| Containerization | Docker |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes |
| Service Mesh | Istio |
| Traffic Management | Ingress, API Gateway |
| Cloud Providers | AWS, Azure |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform |
| Monitoring | Prometheus |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions, ArgoCD |

## Installation & Deployment
### Prerequisites
- Docker & Kubernetes installed
- AWS or Azure CLI configured
- Terraform installed
- Helm package manager

### Deployment Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Shaheer4636/Shaheer-Microservices-CloudLab.git
   cd Shaheer-Microservices-CloudLab
   ```
2. Deploy infrastructure using Terraform:
   ```sh
   cd deployment/terraform/aks  # Change to EKS if using AWS
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
3. Deploy microservices to Kubernetes:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes-manifests/
   ```
4. Set up Istio service mesh:
   ```sh
   istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
   kubectl apply -f istio-manifests/
   ```
5. Configure monitoring with Prometheus:
   ```sh
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
   helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Uses GitHub Actions for build automation.
- ArgoCD manages Kubernetes deployments.
- Helm charts ensure consistent deployments across environments.

## Monitoring & Logging
- **Prometheus** collects and visualizes application metrics.
- **Fluentd/ELK Stack** provides centralized logging and alerting.
